In this text, Karl Popper presents his thoughts about when a theory is scientific or not. For this, he compares theories like Albert Einstein’s theory of confirmation, Karl Marx’s theory of history, Freud’s psycho-analysis and Alfred Adler’sindividual psychology. He says that the last 3 are non-scientific theories because they seem to be able to explain every event of their domain, even when it seems to be refutable, it is possible to include an ad hoc assumption. It is important to say that a theory to be non-scientific does not mean that it is insignificant.Karl Popper concludes that what makes a theory scientific is its falsiability.
