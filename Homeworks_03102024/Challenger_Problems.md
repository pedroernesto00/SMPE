# Critical examination of a data analysis

As positive points of the data analysis, I point the use of graphs, because visualize the data is fundamental to understand a relation between variables.

The data analysis has 3 main improvement points:

1. No experimental data for lower temperatures
2. Crucial data were excluded
3. No Confident Interval

## Experiment data for lower temperatures

The minimum temperature in the data analysed was 53 ºF, as the temperature at the launch day was 31 ºF, a huge difference. The lack of data with low temperatures has a crucial impact in the analysis of risk, because it leads to an underestimation.

## Crucial data were excluded

In the beginning of the analysis, the data from experiments where there was no malfunctions were excluded. This way we lost a lot of important information about the conditions that lead to a correct operation.

## No Confidence Interval

The analysis of the confidence interval is a must do, since it provides an information about the uncertainty of the experiment.
